  Prove a visual change by looking at the rendered surface — screenshot it and
  compare to the reference before saying done. Use after any UI, layout, theme,
  or color change, or when the user says it still looks wrong or doesn't match.

# Visual Verify

Never report a visual, layout, or theme change as done based on the diff or a
passing test. Look at the running surface.

## Steps

1. Run the actual surface (dev server, app, TUI/GUI, Storybook — whatever shows
   this UI). Don't start one the user already has running.
2. Capture the current viewport. For responsive web or desktop layouts, also
   render one relevant narrow viewport and capture it. If the environment
   cannot resize, state that limitation and do not claim narrow rendered
   verification.
3. Compare against the reference: the design (Figma/mock), the sibling surface it
   should match, or the before state. Name the specific things you checked
   (color values, equal component padding, outer gutters, control heights,
   wrapping, horizontal overflow, viewport clipping, active state, contrast).
4. If it doesn't match, keep the debug logging and iterate. Only say "done" once
   it visibly matches.

## Don't

- Claim a theme/color change works because the token math looks right — verify
  the rendered value.
- Delete instrumentation while the visual is still wrong.
- Trust unit tests as proof a UI renders correctly.
- Treat a CSS media rule alone as proof that the narrow layout renders
  correctly.
